            <h2>Top 3 Solutions of Obesity:

                Eat better Foods
            </h2>
            <p>Eating healthy is one of the best ways to deal with obesity. Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods like chicken, eggs, or beans. These give your body the energy it needs without too much sugar or fat. Try to cut back on junk food like chips, candy, fast food, and soda, which can lead to weight gain if eaten too often. You don’t need to be perfect—just try to make better choices most of the time. Even small changes, like having fruit instead of cookies or drinking water instead of soda, can really help over time.</p>

            <h3>Move more</h3>
            <p>Being active every day is super important. You don’t have to play a sport or go to a gym—just find fun ways to move your body. You can dance, ride your bike, take a walk, play outside, or even do chores that get you moving. Try to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of activity each day. Moving your body helps burn off extra energy (calories), makes your muscles and heart stronger, and can even help you feel happier and less stressed. Even small things like walking instead of riding in a car or taking the stairs can make a difference. </p>

            <h4>Ask for help</h4>
            <p>You don’t have to face obesity alone. It’s okay to ask for help. Talk to someone you trust, like a parent, school nurse, teacher, or doctor. They can give you advice and help you set simple goals to get healthier. It can also help to do things with a friend or family member—like going for walks or cooking healthy meals together. Having support makes it easier to stay motivated. Start with small steps, like drinking more water or taking a short walk, and build from there. Every little step counts!
