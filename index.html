            <h2>What is Obesity?</h2>
            <p>Obesity is a medical condition where excess body fat negatively affects health, often measured by a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher. It can lead to serious problems like heart disease, diabetes, and sleep disorders. Causes include poor diet, lack of physical activity, genetics, emotional eating, and certain medical issues. However, obesity can be managed by making healthy choices such as eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress. Talking to a doctor can help create a plan to improve health and prevent complications.</p>
