            <h2>What is Obesity?</h2>
            Obesity means having too much body fat.
        It can cause health problems like heart issues, diabetes, and sleep trouble.

        It can happen from:
        
            <ul>
            <li>Eating too much junk food</li>
            <li>Not getting enough exercise</li>
            <li>Family history or feeling sad or stressed</li>
            You can stay healthy by:
            <li>Eating good foods</li>
            <li>Playing and moving everyday</li>
            <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
            <li>Relaxing and feeling happy</li>
        
        
        </ul>

            <h2>What causes Obesity?</h2>
            <p>Obesity can happen for many different reasons.

                One big cause is unhealthy eating, like eating too much junk food or sugary snacks that have lots of calories but not many nutrients. Not getting enough exercise—like running, playing, or moving around—can also lead to weight gain.
                
                Some kids may gain weight because of their genes, which means it runs in their family. Other things, like feeling sad or stressed, not getting enough sleep, or some health problems or medicines, can also make it easier to gain weight.
                
                Where you live can make a difference too. Some people don’t have easy access to healthy food or safe places to play or be active, and that can make it harder to stay at a healthy weight.
                
                But the good news is, learning about these causes can help kids and families make smart choices—like eating better and staying active—to stay healthy and feel great!</p>

            <h2>What are the rates of obesity among children in the pacific islands?</h2>
            <p> <li>More than half of Pacific Islander kids—over 70,000—are overweight or obese.</li>
  <li>Many adults in the Pacific Islands are also very overweight.
    <ul>
      <li>In Nauru, about 61 out of 100 adults are obese.</li>
      <li>Cook Islands and Palau also have lots of obese adults.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reasons for this include:
    <ul>
      <li>Eating foods from other countries that have too much sugar, fat, or salt</li>
      <li>Not having many chances to play, run, or exercise</li>
      <li>Some cultures see being bigger as a sign of wealth or importance</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Having too much body fat can cause serious health problems like heart disease and diabetes.</li>
  <li>Many Pacific Island countries are trying to help people:
    <ul>
      <li>Eat healthier foods</li>
      <li>Be more active</li>
      <li>Stay strong and healthy</li>
            </p>
