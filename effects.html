            <p>Health Problems

                Being overweight can cause serious health problems, even for teens and kids. It raises the risk of getting illnesses like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. These are conditions that used to mostly affect older adults but are now happening more often in younger people because of obesity.

Extra body fat can make it harder for your body to work properly. For example, it can lead to trouble breathing, especially while sleeping, and can make your heart work harder than it should. If not treated, these problems can get worse over time.

The good news is that many of these health issues can be prevented. Eating healthier foods, staying active, and going to regular doctor visits can really help keep your body strong and avoid these problems in the future.</p>

            <p>Joint and Body Pain

              When your body carries more weight than it should, it puts extra pressure on your bones and joints. This can cause pain in places like your knees, hips, and lower back. It also makes it harder to do things like walk, run, or play sports without getting tired or sore.

Over time, the pressure can damage your joints. Some people may even develop joint problems like arthritis, which can make moving around painful. When movement hurts, it’s easy to stop being active, which can make the pain worse.

Keeping your body active and at a healthy weight helps protect your joints. Exercise builds strength and lowers the pressure on your bones and muscles, making it easier to stay active and feel better doing everyday things.</p>

            <p>Feelings and Mental Health

                Being overweight doesn’t just affect your body—it can also make you feel sad or upset. Some kids might feel unhappy with how they look, or they might get picked on by others.

Being teased or left out can make you feel bad about yourself. It can lead to feeling worried, lonely, or even depressed. That can make school or time with friends less fun.

But here’s something important: Your weight doesn’t decide who you are or how special you are. You are amazing just as you are! Talking to someone you trust, like a parent, teacher, or counselor, and making healthy choices can help you feel better inside and out.
