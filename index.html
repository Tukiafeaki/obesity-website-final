            <h2>What is Obesity?</h2>
            <p>Obesity is a medical condition where excess body fat negatively affects health, often measured by a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher. It can lead to serious problems like heart disease, diabetes, and sleep disorders. Causes include poor diet, lack of physical activity, genetics, emotional eating, and certain medical issues. However, obesity can be managed by making healthy choices such as eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress. Talking to a doctor can help create a plan to improve health and prevent complications.</p>

            <h3>What causes Obesity?</h3>
            <p>Obesity is caused by a combination of factors, including unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, and genetics. Consuming high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and not exercising regularly can lead to weight gain. Emotional eating, poor sleep, and certain medical conditions or medications can also contribute to obesity by affecting hunger, metabolism, or fat storage. Environmental factors, like limited access to healthy food or safe places to exercise, make it harder to maintain a healthy weight. Understanding these influences can help people make better choices to prevent or manage obesity.</p>

            <h4>What are the rates of obesity among children in the pacific islands?</h4>
            <p>Obesity rates in the Pacific Islands are among the highest in the world, with countries like Nauru reporting 61% adult obesity and over half of Pacific children in New Zealand classified as overweight or obese. This crisis is driven by a shift from traditional diets to cheap, imported processed foods, limited opportunities for physical activity, and cultural perceptions that associate larger body size with wealth or status. As a result, rates of heart disease, diabetes, and other non-communicable diseases are rising. Pacific nations are responding with public health initiatives to promote healthier eating, physical activity, and traditional lifestyles.
