            <h2>What is Obesity?</h2>
            Obesity means having too much body fat.
        It can cause health problems like heart issues, diabetes, and sleep trouble.

        It can happen from:
        
            <ul>
            <li>Eating too much junk food</li>
            <li>Not getting enough exercise</li>
            <li>Family history or feeling sad or stressed</li>
            You can stay healthy by:
            <li>Eating good foods</li>
            <li>Playing and moving everyday</li>
            <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
            <li>Relaxing and feeling happy</li>
        
        
        </ul>

            <h2>What causes Obesity?</h2>
            <p>Obesity can happen for many different reasons.

                One big cause is unhealthy eating, like eating too much junk food or sugary snacks that have lots of calories but not many nutrients. Not getting enough exercise—like running, playing, or moving around—can also lead to weight gain.
                
                Some kids may gain weight because of their genes, which means it runs in their family. Other things, like feeling sad or stressed, not getting enough sleep, or some health problems or medicines, can also make it easier to gain weight.
                
                Where you live can make a difference too. Some people don’t have easy access to healthy food or safe places to play or be active, and that can make it harder to stay at a healthy weight.
                
                But the good news is, learning about these causes can help kids and families make smart choices—like eating better and staying active—to stay healthy and feel great!</p>

            <h2>What are the rates of obesity among children in the pacific islands?</h2>
            <p>More than half of the children who are Pacific Islanders—over 70,000 kids—are either overweight or obese. That means their bodies have too much fat, which can make them unhealthy.

                In the Pacific Islands, many people have some of the highest obesity rates in the whole world. For example, in a place called Nauru, about 61 out of every 100 adults are obese—that’s more than half! Other islands like the Cook Islands and Palau also have lots of people who are obese.
                
                One reason for this is that many people eat a lot of food that is brought in from other countries, which often has too much sugar, fat, or salt. These foods have a lot of calories but aren’t very healthy. Also, there aren’t always many chances to run, play, or exercise, so it’s easier to gain weight.
                
                In some Pacific Island cultures, being bigger is sometimes seen as a sign of being wealthy or important. This means that having extra weight can be accepted or even liked.
                
                But having too much body fat can cause serious health problems, like heart disease and diabetes. Because of this, many Pacific Island countries are working hard to help people eat healthier and be more active to stay strong and healthy. Having too much body fat can cause serious health problems.
